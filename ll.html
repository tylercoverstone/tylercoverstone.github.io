		<p style="color: black; margin-left: 30px; margin-right: 30px">This specific program was written to implement the Josephus algorithm using both a linked list and an iterator rather than an array as the data structure. The Josephus algorithm is used with a list of numbers, with which one of the numbers serves as a starting point and a pre-determined "passing" number is counted after the starting number and then the number that is landed on is removed from the list. The next number assumes the role of the starting number and the process is continued until there is one element remaining. This program was written in Java, and the source code can be found on my Github account.</p>
