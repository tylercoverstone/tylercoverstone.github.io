	<h1>Hi, my name is Tyler.</h1>
	<p style="margin-left: 375px; margin-right: 375px; margin-top: 160px;">I am a second year, undergraduate student of Computer Science at the University of North Florida. I built this website to tell a little bit about myself, my professional experience, and to host a list of projects that I have completed or worked on in the past.</p>
